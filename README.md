# License Choice
For my project I chose to apply the **MIT License**. This project is supposed to be a graphing application that utilizes
these sorting and search algorithms to allow easier implementation and handling of passed data. Visual graphs have many applications
and is a great form of data representation. For how often they can be used, I want this project to be very accessible for anyone
who wants to use it, and I see the MIT License a perfect fit for that.
