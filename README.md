Algorithms Dependency - https://github.com/aalhour/C-Sharp-Algorithms

# License Choice
For my project I chose to apply the **MIT License**. This project is supposed to be a graphing application that utilizes
these sorting and search algorithms to allow easier implementation and handling of passed data. Visual graphs have many applications
and is a great form of data representation. For how often they can be used, I want this project to be very accessible for anyone
who wants to use it, and I see the MIT License, being very permissive, a perfect fit for that. Users can modify the work as they please and can
distribute it however they desire. The only thing I can not guarantee, is distributed work based off this project or work that uses this project as a dependency,
sharing the source code, as the MIT License does not require contributors to do so. This license's conditions is for anyone that uses it to keep a copy of the actual
license within the project and to maintain the original coyright notice as well.
